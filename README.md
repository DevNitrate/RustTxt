# Rust text editor

I made this project with no keyboard so consider subscribing to my [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@devnitrate)

## Installation

1. Clone this project
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DevNitrate/RustTxt.git
   ```
2. Build the project
   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. Move the *./target/release/text-editor* to where you desire and you can rename it to whatever you want

## Usage

**Note that the app only works for files in the same directory as the app .exe file unless you use _./_ and/or _../_**

Open the *.exe* file and write some text or load a file by putting the file name in the input at the left of the load button which you will then press (at this point if the file was valid it should have created it otherwise it will close the app) and then when you want to save the file put the file name to save in the input at the left of the save button which you will then press (if file name is empty it will not crash but it won't save the file).

## I am encountering problems
